# Intrdouction
This is an introduction to R. I promise this will be fun. 

## R console
Writing code is fun. So open up R, and you’ll see something like this:
![R console](R_Console.png)

when loading R-Studio it will look like this
![R-Studio](R-Studio.png)

You can do math:
```{r}
1+1
```

Strings are always fun to start with, type a set of letters together within quotes and the console will print it back to you
```{r}
"Hello Mr Tickles"
```
```{r}
"This is a string"
```

Double quotes and single quotes are more or less interchangable, but is better practice to stick with double quotes.

# Variables

Another thing you’ll want to do using R is assign things to a name so that you can use it later. Think of this as being if you were a chipmunk and you buried a nut in the ground to dig up later. You can assign anything in R to a __name__, then use it later (in the current R session of course :)).

Assign the number 5 to the name `mynumber`
```{r}
mynumber <- 5
```

Later you can use `mynumber` , like adding it to another number 
```{r}
mynumber + 1
```

Sweet!

# Vectors
Vectors are one of the simplest and common objects in R. Think of a vector like a cat’s tail. Some are short. Some are long. But they are are pretty much the same width - that is, they can only contain a single data type. So a vector can only have all `numeric` , all `character` , all `factor` , etc.

But how do we make a `vector`? The easiest way is to use a function called `c`  So `c(5,6,7)` will create a vector of numbers 5, 6, and 7. 
```{r}
c(5,6,7)
```

Making a value as double will make all other values double
```{r}
c(5, 8, 200, 1, 1.5, 0.9)
```


Let’s say you have a vector of three types of animals:
```{r}
animals <- c("birds","squirrels","fish")
animals
```

You can add something to each of them like
```{r}
paste(animals, "are beautiful")
```


# Data frames
A `data.frame` is one of the most commonly used objects in R. Just think of a `data.frame` like a table, or a spreadsheet, with `rows` and `columns` and `numbers`, `text`, etc. in the cells. A very special thing about the `data.frame` in R is that it can handle multiple types of data - that is, each column can have a different type. Like in the below table the first column is of numeric type, the second a `factor`, and the third `character`.

```{r}
df <- data.frame(hey=c(5,6,7), there=as.factor(c("a","b","c")),
             fella=c("blue","brown","green"))
df
```

Notice that the first column of numbers are actually row names, and are not part of the data.frame per se, though are part of the metadata for the `data.frame`.

We can quickly get a sense for the type of data in the `df` object by using the function `str` , which gives information on the types of data in each column.

```{r}
str(df)
```

## Matrices
Think of a matrix in R like a data.frame with all the same type of data, only numeric, only character, etc. A matrix is technically a special case of a two- dimensional array.

```{r}
mat <- matrix(c(1,2,3, 11,12,13), nrow = 2, ncol = 3)
```

```{r}
mat
```

# Lists
Lists are quite special. They are kinda like vectors, but kinda not. Using our cat tail analogy again, lists are like cat tails in that they can be short or long, but they can also vary in width. That is, they can hold any type of object. Whereas vectors can only hold one type of object (only `character` for example), lists can hold for example, a `data.frame` and a `numeric` , or a `data.frame` and another `list`! The way we make a `list` is via the function __`list`__

```{r}
list(1, "a")
```

A nested list
```{r}
mylist <- list(1, list("a","b","c")) 
mylist
```

Just like vectors, you can do operations on each element of the list. However, since lists can be nested you have to worry about what level of nesting you want to manipulate.

```{r}
mylist[[1]]
```

```{r}
mylist[[2]]
```

```{r}
mylist[[2]][[1]]
```


# Indexing
Okay, so let’s say you have made a `vector`, `list`, or `data.frame`. How do you get to the things in them? Its slightly different for each one. There is a general way to index objects in R that can be used across `vectors`, `lists`, and `data.frame`. That is the square bracket: `[]`. For some objects you can index by the sequence number (e.g., `5` ) of the thing you want, while with others you can do that, but also index by the character name of the thing (e.g., `kitty`).

## vectors
Vectors only have one dimension, as we said above. So with `[]` there is only one number to give here. For example, let’s say we have the vector
```{r}
bb <- c(5,6,7)
```

We can index to each of those 3 numbers by the sequence of its place in the vector. Get the 6 by doing

```{r}
bb[2]
```

## named vector
You can also have a named vector. What’s that? A named vector is like `bb` above, but each of the three elements has a name.
```{r}
bb <- c(5,6,7)
names(bb) <- c("hey","hello","wadup") 
bb
```


```{r}
names(bb)
```

With a named vector we can get to each element in the vector using its name with a single set, or double set of brackets to get the value, or the value and name, respectively.

```{r}
bb["hello"]
```

```{r}
bb[["hello"]]
```

## lists
Indexing on lists is similar to vectors. A huge difference though is that lists can be nested. So there could be infinite things within each slot of a list. For example, let’s say we have the nested list from above `mylist`

```{r}
mylist <- list(foo=1, bar=list("a","b","c"))
```

We can index to the first item in the list, including its name, by
```{r}
mylist[1]
```
Or equivalently

```{r}
mylist["foo"]
```

And get just the value by using two `[`

```{r}
mylist[[1]]
```

Or equivalently
```{r}
mylist[["foo"]]
```

## data.frame and matrix

Indexing on a `data.frame` and `matrix` is similar. Both have two things to index on: `rows` and `columns`. Within `[,]`, the part before the comma is for `rows`, and the part after the comma for `columns`. So if you have a data frame `iris` in R
```{r}
head(iris)
```
You can index to the third row and second column by doing
```{r}
iris[3,2]
```

You can also use names to index if you have named rows or columns. For example,
```{r}
iris[2,"Species"]
```

You can also use the `$` symbol to index to a column, like
```{r}
mtcars$mpg
```


# If statement

The syntax of if statement is:
```{r}
if (test_expression) {
  statement
}
```

If the `test_expression` is `TRUE`, the statement gets executed. But if it’s `FALSE`, nothing happens. Here, `test_expression` can be a logical or numeric vector, but only the first element is taken into consideration. In the case of numeric vector, zero is taken as `FALSE`, rest as `TRUE`.

## Example: if statement

```{r}
x <- 5
if(x > 0){
  print("Positive number")
}
```

# if... else statement

The syntax of if... else statement is:

```{r}
if (test_expression) {
  statement1
} else {
  statement2
}
```

## Example : if... else statement

```{r}
x <- -5
if(x > 0){
  print("Non-negative number")
} else {
  print("Negative number")
}
```


# For Loop
Loops are used in programming to repeat a specific block of code.

```{r}
for (val in sequence){
  statement
}
```

Here, `sequence` is a `vector` and `val` takes on each of its value during the loop. In each iteration, `statement` is evaluated.

## Example: for loop

Below is an example to count the number of __even__ numbers in a vector.

```{r}
x <- c(2,5,3,9,8,11,6)
count <- 0
for (val in x) {
  if(val %% 2 == 0)  
    count = count+1
}
print(count)
```


# Functions
Cats are the type of feline to love functions. Functions make your life easier by allowing you to generalize many lines of code, and avoiding repeating yourself. Functions make your work tidier - just like cats like it. Functions are written like this


```{r}
foo <- function(){
  writeLines("Being a cat, I strongly dislike dogs")
}
```

Now call the `function`
```{r}
foo()
```

The `foo` function was pretty simple. We can also pass in parameters to the function.
```{r}
foo <- function(printVal){ 
  writeLines(printVal)
}
```


```{r}
foo("Being a cat, I strongly dislike dogs")
```

And set parameters to default values.

```{r}
foo <- function(printVal = "Being a cat, I strongly dislike dogs"){ 
  writeLines(printVal)
}
```

```{r}
foo()
foo('I print whatever I like')
```

# Excercise
## Excercise #1
Write a chunk of code that converts 24 hour time into am/pm. Now if the time is more than 12 then it says __It is now pm__ otherwise it says __It is now am__.

```{r code1}
inputTime <- 13
if(inputTime > 12){
  print('It is now pm')
}else{
  print("It is now am")

## Excercise #2
Write for loop to calculate the first 10 terms of Fibonacci sequence. 

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34,... i.e. the third number is calculated by adding up the two numbers before it:

[Hint: Assign the first two numbers in two variables and iterate from third variable]

print(a)
print(b)
for(i in 1:8){
  c <- a + b
  print(c)
  a <- b
  b <- c
}
```

## Excercise #3
Write a function that will say whether a number is prime or not.

[Hint: `%%` would give you the reminder of the calculation. For eg. `5%%2` will give you `1`]

```{r code3}
find_prime <- function(val){
  count <- 0
  for (i in 2:(val/2)) {
    if(val%%i == 0)
      count = count + 1
  }
  #print(count)
  if(count > 0)
    print('It is not a prime number')
  else
    print('It is a prime number')
}

find_prime(23)
```
```{r}
find_prime(21)
```
